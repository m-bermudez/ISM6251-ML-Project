# ISM6251-ML-Project
This project was created as our final project for Machine Learning. The objective of this project was to take a business problem and create a predictive model to help solve said issue. Our business problem chosen was tackling Employee Attrition rate. With our model, we were able to predict which factors would affect employee retention. Our model can intake any potential dataset and return what factors are going to cause the most influence. This allows our model the flexibility of being used in a variety of scenarios.
